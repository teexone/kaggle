# Titanic

This is a solution to quite a classical task on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/titanic/) website. The approach is quite standard one: encoding, data imputation and fine-tuning of a random forest classifier. The only interesting thing might be an age data imputation: for a portion of data an age median is computed only with respect to person's sex and size of a family.
